Refine and Fix the Terminal Space Homepage UI/UX:
	1.	Remove Both Dots in the Top Right Corner:
	•	These controls do not currently provide meaningful functionality and should be removed to prevent user confusion and clean up the interface.
	2.	Fix AI Summary Modal:
	•	Make the modal scrollable on all screen sizes if the content exceeds viewport height.
	•	Ensure that clicking outside the modal or pressing “Escape” also closes it.
	•	Add a visible scroll indicator (like a subtle bar) to clarify that more content exists below the fold.
	3.	Typography Upgrade:
	•	Replace the current font throughout the app with a clean, modern, professional typeface like IBM Plex Sans, Space Grotesk, or Sora.
	•	Ensure consistency in font size, line height, and spacing for all text elements (titles, body, buttons, tooltips).
	4.	Navigation and Button Improvements:
	•	Move the AI Summary modal into a proper “About” or “How It Works” section in the top navbar.
	•	Add an “About” nav item and move the modal trigger there. Clicking “AI Summary” next to Latest News should now just highlight or scroll to the new About section.
	5.	Compare Articles Panel:
	•	If the second dot was meant to trigger a Compare Articles window:
	•	Build a functional article comparison flow:
	•	Add “Compare” buttons to each article card.
	•	When 2 articles are selected, show a side-by-side comparison page or modal.
	•	Display metrics like Bias, Summary, Emotional Tone, and Facts side-by-side.
	6.	Interactive Polish:
	•	Ensure all hover effects are subtle and consistent.
	•	Fix any button hover states that cause unexpected flickering, dimming, or glow that obscures legibility.
	7.	Design Cohesion:
	•	Verify that the MidJourney circle-core background stays centered and subtly animated.
	•	Keep shimmer and glow non-distracting, soft, and in the background layer only.
	•	Maintain consistency in border-radius, padding, and spacing between all cards and containers.
	8.	Accessibility Enhancements:
	•	Ensure contrast ratios are WCAG compliant.
	•	Add proper keyboard navigation support (Tab to jump through interactive elements).
	•	Add ARIA labels for important controls like Search, Categories, and AI Summary.
