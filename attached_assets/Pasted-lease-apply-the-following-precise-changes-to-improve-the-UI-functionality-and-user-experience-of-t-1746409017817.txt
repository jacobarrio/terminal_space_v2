lease apply the following precise changes to improve the UI, functionality, and user experience of the Terminal Space app:

⸻

1. Fix or Remove Incomplete UI Elements:
	•	Top-right dot icons:
	•	Remove both dot icons unless they serve a clear, functional purpose.
	•	If keeping the “Compare Articles” feature:
	•	Add a clearly labeled “+ Compare” button to each article card.
	•	When at least two articles are selected, show a side-by-side comparison view with source info, bias slider, emotional tone, and key points.
	•	Include a “Clear Comparison” button to reset selections.
	•	Hide this feature entirely if it’s not ready or intuitive.
	•	Search/Filter Buttons:
	•	Ensure all icon buttons (search, filters, etc.) have clear tooltips on hover and cursor changes to pointer when interactive.

⸻

2. AI Summary Modal Improvements:
	•	Move the “AI Summary” button to the top navigation bar under a new nav item: “About”.
	•	Only trigger the modal when the “AI Summary” button is clicked.
	•	Apply a cleaner modal layout, modern font, and readable line spacing.
	•	Add a soft fade-in animation for modal appearance and a visible close button.

⸻

3. Typography & Readability:
	•	Replace the current font with a modern, readable web-safe font such as:
	•	Inter, Space Grotesk, or Poppins.
	•	Ensure consistent use of font weights and sizes for:
	•	Titles, article text, category buttons, and modal content.
	•	Add an optional “Reader Mode” toggle in the top nav or settings:
	•	When enabled, it increases font size slightly and boosts contrast for accessibility.

⸻

4. Polish & Interactivity Enhancements:
	•	Standardize button hover animations across the app (gold glow with smooth transitions).
	•	Ensure all icons and interactive elements have proper hover states and visual feedback.
	•	Refine padding/margin across sections to ensure proper spacing (especially top/bottom of cards and containers).

⸻

5. Optional but Recommended:
	•	Add an Onboarding Tip on first visit:
	•	A dismissible popup or tooltip set that highlights major features (e.g., “Use Compare to analyze articles side by side”).
	•	Add a Theme Toggle in the settings or nav:
	•	Toggle between Light/Dark modes for broader user preference support.
	•	Consider a “Saved Articles” or Bookmark feature in the top bar for future expansion.
